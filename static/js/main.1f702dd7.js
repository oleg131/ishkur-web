It\'s probably the offbeat bass stabs that lend credence to its defining \'stupid\' sound. And the horn fanfares, making it sound like silly circus music. And the crowd cheering samples, which make it seem cheap and gimmicky. But where other party music (Happy Hardcore, Eurodance) has a self-aware, tongue-in-cheek affability, Stupid House here legitimately tries to pass itself off as something serious and genuine. Like actual contentious music. A chip-on-its-shoulder, more-hardcore-than-thou ethos, something so laughably ridiculous even Gabber House looks cooler in comparison. Pretending to be what it\'s not makes this whole genre fraudulent and insulting to those who just want to have a good time. And that\'s before you see how the kids dance to it.

Deep House is the sound that holds the whole genre together. There are several sub-sub-genres of this, all of it good, including Mark Farina\'s own special brand of Mushroom Jazz. One of my favourites is a really swanky, soulful sub-sub-genre tentatively named (meaning, called only by my friends and I) \\"Dad House\\", because it always evokes images of your father walking around the house in his bathrobe on a Sunday morning, reading the paper and smoking on a pipe.

It\'s dedication to silly, spastic fun, with buff dancers running around and funny raps about dancing, love, and the love of dancing has made an artform out of the lighter side of music.

The public accepted everything, calling it all Techno for some reason. This genre didn\'t really have a name--then or now. Everyone called everything Techno so it was hard to place the evolution, origin or progression of any kind of set sound or music.

But they all sang in english, which is odd because english was universally a second language to them, as evidenced by the fact that the lyrics make no sense and the vocalists have thick accents of indeterminate origin. Still, despite these shortcomings, the music kicks ass, and is recognized as the world\'s first completely electronic commercial dance music, predating House, Techno, Electro, and just about everything else.

Today, electronic musicians--especially the bad ones--seem to be mostly lazy, uncreative morons who don\'t know a damn thing about music because they let the sequencer and preset banks do all the work.

Melodic hooks, pop lines, all the tools of the trade are there, only this time with synthesizers. MIDI definitely contributed to this explosion. And now its undergoing a renaissance due to the almighty power of Retro.

Machines allowed making the music easier, faster, and cheaper, but they also brought on a whole bunch of other things. The 80s proved to be the coming-out party for electronic music, as within a year of Disco\'s infamous backlash everyone, from Reggae (Eddy Grant) to Funk (George Clinton) to Jazz (Herbie Hancock) to movie soundtracks (The Warriors) would employ electronic instruments with glee.

I am no different, which is why I call it \'Synthtron\', because Electroclash sounds like the stupidest name I\'ve ever heard. Though it may more be appropriately applied to the grittier, guitar-infused punk artists (Chicks on Speed, Fischerspooner, Add N to (X), Orgy), I can\'t see it being a justifiable term for their House-bred contemporaries (Felix da Housekat, Miss Kitten and the Hacker, Ladytron, Adult., Who da Funk, Northern Lite) who are, once again, following the wake of pioneers Thomas Bangalter and Les Rythmes Digitales, who were spearheading this retro 80s trend back in 1996.

But to the Epic Trance scene, Futurepop seems at once impersonal and harsh, a product of the dark, brooding Industrial scene that is disdainful to their sensitive, trance attuned ears.

So when the goths finally decided that their melodrama would work really well with machines, of course they called it Darkwave. They probably wanted to call it Blackwave, but that.....hey, why didn\'t they call it that? I guess it beats calling it Electro-goth (some people might tell you there is a difference between the two genres, but don\'t listen to them).

And besides, if the DJ\'s too stupid and inept to figure out how to provide adequate tension and release during his sets through careful track selection and record management, why not do it for him, essentially removing any skill he thought he might\'ve needed to have in order to be a good DJ. Breakdowns, builds, and memorable melodies are not a new thing in trance. But what Anthem Trance did was completely and totally abuse and pervert them.

Sometime in the mid-90s trance decided to drop the technique of slowly introducing complicated layers and building adequate tension over long stretches, replacing them with cutesy little insta-melodies (Robert Miles may actually be to blame for this). That made it more pop culture accessible. The average attention span, way too ritalin-freaked to pay attention to the slow, brooding trance in its original form, liked the anthemic singalong tone of the NEW McTrance, and that\'s why all you trance crackers are reading this right now.

Music that rewards paying attention and looking inward, on a meditative level. Music that you can get lost in. Parties that last several days, and songs that last 8 hours. You don\'t hear that anymore. Today Trance is either a sequence of disjointed, disaffected, unrelated predictable anthems laid out one after the other (hardly entrancing), or is completely overshadowed and drowned out by the posturing and hero-worship of people who really do nothing more than operate a glorified stereo."},"germantrance":{"genre":"germantrance","node":"German","title":"German Trance","aka":null,"type":"Trance","scene":null,"decade":"80s","description":"DIES IST TECHNO SEX!!

That is, not dwelling on heavy, uplifting, emotional shmaltz. But especially the acid. From this genre came two offspring: one took just the acid and became Hard Acid Trance. The other took just the bouncey basslines and became NRG. There\'s nothing wrong with straight-ahead, dancey pop beats.

The parties were free, mobile, and clandestine. The rules were few, the regulations were none, and the organization was whatever needed to keep the party going. The rave movement became so large and so threatening to daily life that it culminated in the Criminal Justice Bill of 94, and the trial of 13 members of Spiral Tribe for \\"Conspiracy to Cause a Public Nuisance\\".

A late arrival of New Jack Swing, Boys II Men, completely took the genre into a new direction: subdued, minimal beat (christ, some tracks have nothing more than a metronome counter), and them, front and centre, bellowing out annoying, modulating oversinging that spans seventeen thousand octaves and lasts thirty hours long. This overused technique, exploited the most by Mariah Carey, would segue into the genre Nu Soul, dominated by picky, sassy divas emulating her, who would in turn drive the idea of the artist as a companion to the music into the ground and render the genre completely and totally unlistenable.

Their DJs, doing far more competent work in the background, received little to no recognition no matter how many shoutouts the MCs gave them, because as is the case in the pop world, the image of the artist is more important than the music.

It perfectly fit the music, which was fat (and phat), slow, hazy funk, biting Ohio Players Club\'s funky worm, Zapp\'s vocoders, and George Clinton\'s farting bass. It was a reactionary stance by west coast rappers to pretend that the east coast rappers\' neo-gangster look didn\'t phaze them. This sparked the infamous East coast-West Coast rivalry, which peaked in the late 90s with many deaths on either side, including the two high-profile ones of Tupac Shakur of the west and Notorious B.I.G. of the east.

But the issue isn\'t really who is more hardcore than who, or who is more misogynistic or more foul-mouthed or more OGT........it\'s really all about who has the most money. See, the only real objective standard of comparison that a rapper can count on is his popularity. Popularity means record sales, and record sales mean humongous profits. Thus, it stands to reason that the wealthiest rappers must be the best. So with both sides pushing each other, visible signs of frivolous wealth has become the benchmark of a rapper\'s rapping ability.

It doesn\'t even seem right to call them DJs. It\'s unfair that these people are given the same title as some idiot blathering away on morning radio, or a tacky human stereo playing cds at a wedding.

The problem was that it was immensely successful as a result, and etched into stone the blueprint for all rap music forever: confrontational and violent. It was popular because white kids--living their boring, suburban lives of watered down leisure patterns and drab social conformity--listened to it, and became enthralled with the adventurous, dangerous, decadent, high-strung quality of life in the ghettos that was invariably more exciting than theirs. Hollywood movies and the LA riots of \'92 did well to hype up this image, but the reality was probably far more tame: less like Boyz n the Hood and more like Friday. Ruthless Records was the staple here, but realistically all of West Coast Rap is built around a single trump card......but it\'s a very good trump card: Dr. Dre."},"electro":{"genre":"electro","node":"Electro","title":"Electro","aka":"Electropop, Robot Pop, Technopop","type":"Breakbeat","scene":"Hip Hop","decade":"70s","description":"Motherfucking electro!

The choice to use that word was definitely not random. Ice T just happened to be on the show that night, and he likely fed the word to them beforehand and certainly helped fuel its popularity during the telecast (\\"That was seriously crunked up, right there.\\"). But Ice never claimed to have come up with the word--he probably got it from Dirty South rappers, who had been using it for years as a euphemism for getting really crazy and fucked up on marijuana and alcohol (stoned and drunk. Chronic plus Drunk = Crunk). Or maybe crack and drunk. Or coke and drunk. Or maybe just being crazy and drunk. Whatever it is, it means getting really crazy and fucked up. And with Conan\'s introduction of the word to northern suburban audiences, Crunk came into its own as the recognized sound of the new generation of Dirty South Rap, prompting white college fratboys everywhere to wander around going \\"WHHHUT!!

We saw the album for what it really was: stupid, silly, dumb, full of filthy language and toilet humour, and deliberately pushing the buttons of grownups. It wasn\'t until years later that the full influence of the album hit home: dirty down south booty bass music, taking the panhandle by storm and ignoring the east coast/west coast dichotomy in rap music, was party music through and through. The gang vocals, the raunchy choruses, and the deep, throbbing bass--the turing test for any phat ride\'s bumpin\' subs--is wholly and completely unignorable.

It is a recreation of the sounds in our modern technological society through an abrasive form. In this instance, then, what is commonly considered noise is not. It is simply part of our surroundings through a grual introduction. For instance, imagine living in the city, seeing nothing but glass and steel and concrete consuming our daily grind like an apathetic beast shoveling food into its bottomless belly. Imagine also the sounds that go along with it, the jackhammers and cars and hustle and bustle of people moving about. These sounds have become so much part of our daily consciousness that we don\'t even notice it anymore. In fact, if it gets too quiet, we feel uncomfortable, as exemplified by our need to have a television set on in our home all the time, even if we aren\'t watching it. If you go out into a desert, or a lake, or someplace secluded from everything so that there is no sound anywhere for miles and no wind, hold your breath and open your mouth, you can actually hear the blood flowing through your ears. An interesting trick, yes, but it brings about the realization that total and complete silence is not actually capable to us. Unless you were born deaf, you have never known total and complete quiet; that is, zero sound waves reverberating in your ears. There is always a constant sound with you, even if it\'s your own heartbeat. An interesting way of looking at things, but at the same time it\'s also rather disturbing. I think the point I\'m trying to make in all this is when it really comes down to it we need noise in our lives because we can\'t imagine living without it. Furthermore, despite this necessity--nay, DEPENDANCY--on the sounds of life and the world around us, and how pleasing this noise actually makes us feel, Noisecore as a genre is definitely not something we are looking for, and you are much better off simply disregarding it entirely and taking everything I just said as a huge collossal waste of time."},"powerelectronics":{"genre":"powerelectronics","node":"Power Electronics","title":"Power Electronics","aka":"Power Noise","type":"Hardcore","scene":null,"decade":"90s","description":"Ah yes, the official genre named by Tim \'The Toolman\' Taylor.

Legend purports that this music emerged when some DJ accidently played an acid house record at 33 RPM (not 45, its intended speed). This slowed things really down, to like 100 BPM, and it made the music really sinister and drolling. The trend caught on, and soon producers were making up for its ultra-slow house groove by making the beat harder, fuller, and louder, like a clanging hammer on an anvil.

Of course that horrified the purists, but fascinated their colleagues who said \\"shit, this stuff really can make music\\". In a limited way. But it took them awhile to figure out that making music the old fashion way with electronic equipment, while possible, wasn\'t utilizing the things to the best of their capabilities.

There were Belgians too). It came into its own around about the same time the Italians discovered the genius of the galloping, arpeggiated synth, which kind of steamrolled French Pop into obscurity. But it did produce the most unintentionally awful cult movie of all time: Sgt.

Music so redundant that the only thing that made them dancefloor-worthy was the DJ, there to mix, match, splice, and play them together to create musical collages.

Pink Floyd aka \\"that sound effects band\\" became famous for this reason, but the group that really kicked things off were The Beatles with their track \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", which may very well be the most important track in electronic music history, simply for the Musique Concrete techniques it used which, to society at large, was utterly bizarre.

It was this playful, quirky, little poppy electronic music, and it was produced by these guys here. Like all things from the old-old-old days, this was not a genre, but part of a growing movement. Contrary to popular belief, Kraftwerk were not the only ones making upbeat electronic pop music. A whole wing of this stuff was being churned out for TV and movies and--yes--children\'s read-along audio cassettes in the 70s. Up until now, electronic music was dork music; adult, sophmoric, stuffy, unenlightening, and just not fun. It was dominated not by musicians and entertainers, but by math and electronics geeks out to showcase their latest feats as circuit board designers, which seems appropriate given the repulsively complex and clunky apparatuses they were using to make this music. But one song in 1972 changed all that, and this is good trivia to impress chicks with at parties: Hot Butter - Popcorn. It was the first ever electronic song that charted. And by charted, I mean, like...REAL record charts. Which means people actually purchased it. In stores. Because they liked it. And it CHARTED.

I personally think that the guys, being musicians first and technologists second, got their hands on all sorts of musical equipment that they didn\'t know how to use, but they were intellectual enough to bullshit their way through using it by pretending their post-modern crap compositions were really nouveau \\"art\\".

It was coined by the North American music press to refer to the second wave of electronic music\'s explosion in the late 90s, and exists purely as a marketing buzzword, not any actual quantifiable branch of music (the first wave of electronic music, incidentally, they called \'techno\', and, having driven the word into the ground beyond all sense of meaning, they couldn\'t keep using it if they wished to re-market the music). Daft Punk, Fatboy Slim, Prodigy\'s \'Fat of the Land\', Chemical Brothers and other big-time stars of that period were all called \\"electronica\\" at one point or another, but the person who really popularized it in the public consciousness was Madonna and her shallow, William Orbit-produced piss-poor attempt at appropriating trance music as something she invented (Ray of Light). She used that word all the damn time in interviews. God I hate her. So yeah: There is no such thing as electronica. I want each and every one of you to stop calling it that, because it makes you sound like a god damn retard. If you want to talk about the music as a whole, simply call it what it is: \\"electronic music\\" (or EDM--Electronic Dance Music--for the club/rave stuff). This is a PSA from the Official Electronic Music Genre Standards and Classifications Consortium."},"soundcollage":{"genre":"soundcollage","node":"Sound Collage","title":"Sound Collage","aka":"Tape Music, Sound Sculpting, Sampling","type":"Downtempo","scene":null,"decade":"90s","description":"To the anarchistic, culture jamming, kopyright liberating post-punk pranksters who make it known that music is free, sampling is an end in itself, not a means. It is both art, canvas, paint and brush. But it is more than just a form of music. It is an ideology, encapsulated within the fundamental belief that art is an expression, not property. It is to be explored, not controlled. Yet this simple recognition of the aesthetic worshipping of sonic liberty has made it the most illegal music in the world. But you know what? They don\'t care. They will sample anything they damn well please. You can not stop them. They will sample your hit single. They will sample you complaining about sampling your hit single. They will sample you trying to stop them from sampling your hit single. And when you sue them, they will sample that too. They will take anything that fuels culture and powers society, and appropriate it for their own uses. To them, anything you say is simply raw material."},"worldbeat":{"genre":"worldbeat","node":"Worldbeat","title":"Worldbeat","aka":"Ethnic","type":"Downtempo","scene":null,"decade":"90s","description":"Everything that doesn\'t fit into Western Civilization, with a nice tempo. Or artists who go into the deepest African jungles to sample the noises or go live with the lip-stretching tribe of Borneo to learn the clicking languages of the natives and come back and make music from it in an attempt to convince the rest of us that they are \\"cultured\\". Yes, ever since the Beatles visited the Maharishi and came back with sitar strings noosed around their necks, musicians have been relentlessly experimentative with finding out what other cultures think about music, and then exploiting it. This isn\'t a bad thing, it\'s just an apparent thing. Just don\'t ever pretend that you are some ethnically tolerant, globally conscious individual because you bought a Pure Moods cd."},"ambienthouse":{"genre":"ambienthouse","node":"Ambient House","title":"Ambient House","aka":null,"type":"Downtempo","scene":null,"decade":"80s","description":"As history would have it, Ambient House is pretty much synonymous with the early 90s Ambient revitalization of Ambient stuff pioneered in the 70s by Eno and company and pussified into New Age and ethnic world music in the 80s, but I\'m going to take a more literal route (as I am with everything else on here): it\'s Ambient with a House beat. The artists and tracks might often be confused for Ambient Trance or Ambient Techno, but they\'re not. No, I won\'t explain what the difference is. If this is the last genre you\'ve come to and you can\'t figure it out for yourself by now, I\'m through explaining this stupid electronic music shit to you. Go bug a local DJ about it instead. It\'s not like anyone else is really going to care at this point."},"ethereal":{"genre":"ethereal","node":"Ethereal","title":"Ethereal","aka":"Neo-Classical, Neo-Folk, Ambient Goth ","type":"Downtempo","scene":null,"decade":"80s","description":"Ethereal is like Ambient for goths, and technically not electronic music (half the time), but it\'s important in the development of New Age, Dark Ambient, Darkwave, and other related styles. Ethereal music is a lot of whining and chanting and pagan/wiccan/celtic type stuff, which totally rules if all the mother earth priestesses look like Shannon Doherty and Fairuza Balk. It is also incredibly operatic, melodramatic, dark and morbid....even for goths."},"newage":{"genre":"newage","node":"New Age","title":"New Age","aka":"Easy Listening","type":"Downtempo","scene":null,"decade":"80s","description":"New Age. Wow. What can be said about New Age. To start, this likes to cling onto the western post-modern meditative-yoga-pilates-tai chi new age baby boomer pop philosophies trend and not let go (hence the name: New Age). That should give you a hint right there that anyone who thinks The Celestine Prophecy is a good book has the worst taste in music. Unlike Ambient, there is singing here, not all of which are celtic chants, choir crooning or aboriginal jibber-jabber (that\'s mostly Worldbeat stuff anyway). New Age is floaty, dreamy, and effeminate--even the stuff made by the guys (who have no genitals, by the way). If you have trouble finding it in your local music store, that\'s because it\'s in the ADULT CONTEMPORARY section....yeah, beside Celine Dion and Phil Collins, Jesus Christ. The music itself isn\'t actually all that bad, but the people who listen to it are fucking tools. It\'s really hard to find a New Age composer these days that you wouldn\'t wanna rather give a swift kick in the shins."}}'),u=JSON.parse('{"2stepgarage":[{"genre":"2stepgarage","number":8,"artist":"The Artful Dodger Feat.
