This is an homage to Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music v2.5, ported to work without Flash. Music and descriptions were extracted from the original SWF files. A lot of data can be found at [ishkurs-guide-dataset](https://github.com/igorbrigadir/ishkurs-guide-dataset). I couldn't come up with an effective way to show the tree structure that would work on both desktop and mobile, so I decided to leave it as is. The backdrops are static images and links are just image maps generated with [@qiuz/react-image-map](https://github.com/qiuziz/react-image-map). Audio files were converted to m4a, because mp3 audio can't be looped effectively (they include a short silence in the beginning of the file).
